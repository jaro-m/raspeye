# Raspeye
Raspeye is my project that I started to explore Python. I wanted to test some ideas and try different methods/ways to do one thing.
As I still learn few things, the main target is to make it working as soon as possible, because I still believe it might be an interesting 'toy' not only for me.
Raspeye is a client-server project which means... there are actually 2 separate apps (the one in this repository is client and in another repository there's server - nearly fully working now)

As I wanted to try guizero - a module to quickly build GUIs - there's raspeye-guiz.py in the repo that uses it. To be honest it's nearly working... It might even stop the server, which I thought it was very stable ;)
It's just first release of raspeye-guiz.py, motion-detection (in the GUI) does nothing ATM.
I will be focused on QT in the future (and possibly on tkinter and pygtk as well)


For more info head to [_raspeye-server_](https://github.com/usrbit/raspeye-server) repository.

I don't have time to develop this project quickly, but I try to do what I can to make some progress and make it usable at least.
