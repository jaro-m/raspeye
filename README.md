# Raspeye
Raspeye is my project that I started when I got the camera module for my Raspberry Pi Zero.
I develop it for myself, but believe it might be an interesting 'toy' for others as well.
Raspeye is a client-server project which means... there are actually 2 separate apps (the one in this repository is client and there's server in another repository - nearly fully working now).

As I wanted to try guizero - a module to quickly build GUIs - there's raspeye-guiz.py

I will be focused on QT in the future (and possibly on tkinter and pygtk as well)


For more info head to [_raspeye-server_](https://github.com/usrbit/raspeye-server) repository.

Any feedback welcome.
